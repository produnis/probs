\title{Independent Identical Experiments
Sets up a probability space corresponding to independent, identical experiments.}
\usage{
iidspace(x, ntrials, probs = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a vector of outcomes}

\item{ntrials}{number of times to perform the experiment.}

\item{probs}{vector of non-negative weights corresponding to \code{x}.}
}
\description{
Independent Identical Experiments
Sets up a probability space corresponding to independent, identical experiments.
}
\details{
The elementary experiment to be repeated consists of drawing an element of \code{x} according to the probabilities contained in \code{probs}.  The entries of \code{probs} need not sum to one, but they will be normalized before any computations. If \code{probs} is not specified, the equally likely model will be assumed.
}
\examples{
iidspace( 1:6, ntrials = 3) # same as rolldie(3)
iidspace( 1:6, ntrials = 3, probs = 3:8 ) # unbalanced die
