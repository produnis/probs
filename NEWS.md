# probs 0.9.9

* Every function that had an manual entry in the old `prob` package was rescued and included.
* Functions that have **not** been rescued are those from `characteristicfunctions.r`. I don't know what they are for, maybe they have been there for educational reasons. The first of these functions calls the `fAsianOptions`-package, which is why `prob` was archived on CRAN.

# probs 0.0.1

* initial setup of the package on github, see [https://github.com/produnis/probs](https://github.com/produnis/probs).
* added my most missed functions from the package archive found at (see [https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/prob/](https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/prob/))
