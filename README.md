# probs

A framework for performing elementary probability calculations on finite sample spaces, which may be represented by data frames or lists.  

This package is ment to rescue some widely used functions from the "`prob`" package (see [prob](https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/prob/)). 

Development is done via github, see [https://github.com/produnis/probs](https://github.com/produnis/probs).
